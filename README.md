STEPS

Your program will be parsing and analyzing log files from an Apache web server. The first thing your program must do is retrieve the log file across the network. It is available here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tcmg476/http_access_log (Links to an external site.)

Once you download the file, you need to save a local copy to disk (a cached copy) so the next time you run your script, you don't have to wait for the download.

Marketing wants to know two things: 
How many total requests have been made in the last year?
How many total requests were made in the time period represented by the log?

You will need to output this data to the screen. The format you choose to do this is up to you, but your decisions and your implementation should be logical and consistent.
